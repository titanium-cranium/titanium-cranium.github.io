## About

I am an energetic and thoughtful person, driven for success. Whatever the task, be it building from scratch or debugging complex systems; once I sink my teeth in I don't let go until it's done.  My coding skills are based in Ruby on Rails and I'm more comfortable on the front-end, but have the know-how to do all the back-end logic too. As I studied Psychology in my undergraduate years, I am keen to use those skills to build more intuitive UI/UX and my experimental design and data-analysis expertise to back it up with hard data. Over my career, I also developed advanced technical writing skills for producing scientific journal publications
 as well as procedural manuals. In my free time, if I'm not on my motorbike, or playing soccer with my tween-age son, I find it refreshing to throw away all the boundaries and do creative writing as well, having published three eBooks on<a href="http://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00Q5XS2CO"> Amazon</a>.
