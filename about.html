## About

I am an energetic and thoughtful person, driven for success. Whatever the task, be it building from scratch or debugging complex systems; once I sink my teeth in I don't let go until it's done.  I am a polyglot coding in both Ruby (my first love) and Java (my day job).   I find myself a bit more comfortable slinging objects around in the back-end, but have the know-how to do most front-end stuff too. Along the way I've also picked up some facility with SQL and Javascript/jQuery. In my free time, if I'm not on my motorbike, or playing soccer with my teenage son, I find it refreshing to throw away all the boundaries and do creative writing as well, having published three eBooks on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00Q5XS2CO">Amazon</a>.
