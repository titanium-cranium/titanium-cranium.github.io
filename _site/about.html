## About

I am an energetic and thoughtful person, driven for success. Whatever the task, be it building from scratch
or debugging complex systems; once I sink my teeth in I don't let go until it's done.  I am a polyglot with
professional coding experience in Ruby, Python and ReactJS. I find myself a bit more comfortable writing
scripts and slinging objects around in the back-end, but have the know-how to do most front-end stuff too.
In my free time, if I'm not on my motorbike, or playing soccer with my teenage son, I find it refreshing
to throw away all the boundaries and do creative writing as well, having published three eBooks
on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/-/e/B00Q5XS2CO">Amazon</a>.
