So, I've been busy making a to-do list for the job hunt.  This is what I have so far.  I'm open to all ideas, suggestions, constructive comments and dopeslaps you would like to provide.
#### Plan of attack (in no particular order)

* [x] Update [Blog](titanium-cranium.github.io) Details
* [x] Start Job Hunt Diary
* [x] Update profile on [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bjobrienphd/)

* [ ] Create updated resume PDF for ready distribution
* [x] Contact Recruiters
* [ ] Attend local meetups of [Ruby](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Melbourne/) and [Java](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Melbourne-Java-JVM-Users-Group/) coders
* [ ] Do regular code challenges ([HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/CodeWars)) to freshen up code test skills
* [ ] Setup regular email updates from [Seek](seek.com) for job listings of permanent and contract roles
* [ ]Build up the [Robot Combat Events](www.robotcombatevents.com) Site (my passion project)
    * [ ] Finish [Paypal](https://developer.paypal.com/) integration
    * [ ] Choose/Design/implement New JS Front End to replace Rails views
        * React?
        * Angular?
        * Ember?
        * Node?
    * [ ] Add Readme.md
    * [ ] Get the TDD up to a reasonable level (My Bad, I need to be better about this in future)
    * [ ] Incorporate tags for distribution
* [ ] Advertise my availability on the meetup boards
* [ ] Practice Interview Questions
* [ ] Start applying for jobs
* [x] Contact referees about likely upcoming contact from potential employers.
* Enjoy the extra time with the kids and Buddy the wonderdog.
