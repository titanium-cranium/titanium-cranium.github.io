Well, unfortunately, no progress was made on the job hunt today.  This is both good and bad.  Got to spend a bit of time with the family, which was good.  But also spent a fair bit of time with car mechanics, which was bad.  Will have to get stuck in tomorrow morning until I get to enjoy being Dad and watch as my son tries on his best impression of Alexi Lalas on the soccer pitch, the legendary American defender.

-til tomorrow,

Brendan
