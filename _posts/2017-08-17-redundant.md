Yesterday, I walked into work as per normal, small, strong flat-white in hand, and discovered I'd been made 'redundant.'  This came as quite a shock. I'd only been with the company just over a year and my annual review gave me no indication that my performance was poor.  As it turns out, my boss assured me it had nothing to do with my performance, just that the management team had decided my role was no longer necessary for the company. 
 
### Well crap... that sucks. 

Fortunately, the management at Gate121 were reasonably generous and gave me a redundancy package that would be the equivalent of my salary for the next twelve weeks.  So, the countdown begins:  

## T-84 days and counting...
 
After a day of walking around stunned, I started planning out my job hunt. One of the first elements on my list was to update this blog site. As I hadn't touched this site since I originally created it back in January 2016, I had to re-acquaint myself with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and how it works. And so, here I am, Day 1 writing my first post about the job hunt, what I'm planning/doing, and other bits & pieces along the way.
  
####Ciao for now!
